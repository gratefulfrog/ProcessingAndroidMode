# ProcessingAndroidMode
Tests using Processing.org's Adnroid Mode and Ketai library

Lots of exercises from the book *Rapid Android Development* which have been adapted to actually 
work on my Nexus and Yezz devices. 

This is running on Processing 3.3 and the Android SDK API 6.0 (23).

Nearly all the code works, even if the `Significant Motion` sensor seems to be broken - or maybe my motions
are simply insignificant ?
